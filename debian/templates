Template: watchdog/run
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Start watchdog at boot time?
 Please specify whether watchdog should be started as part of the boot
 process. This can be changed later by editing /etc/default/watchdog.

Template: watchdog/run_keepalive
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Start wd_keepalive after stopping watchdog?
 Please specify whether stopping watchdog should start wd_keepalive to keep on
 triggering the watchdog device. This can be changed later by editing
 /etc/default/watchdog.

Template: watchdog/restart
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Restart watchdog on upgrades?
 If the kernel is configured with the CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT option
 (which is not the default setting), restarting watchdog will cause a
 spurious reboot (the kernel will assume that the watchdog daemon
 crashed).

Template: watchdog/module
Type: string
Default: none
_Description: Watchdog module to preload:
 Please choose which watchdog module should be preloaded before
 starting watchdog. The 'softdog' module should be suited for all
 installations. Enter 'none' if you don't want the script to load
 a module.
